                          completionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be
                          `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`.

                          `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have
                          been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is
                          homologous to each other.

                          `Indexed` means that the Pods of a
                          Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1),
                          available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index.
                          The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
                          for each index.
                          When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and
                          `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5.
                          In addition, The Pod name takes the form
                          `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`,
                          the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`.

                          More completion modes can be added in the future.
                          If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which
                          is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller
                          skips updates for the Job.

                          value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that
                          pod signals the success of the job.
